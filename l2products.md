title: Level-2 products
permalink: /l2products/
---

The CIMR L2PAD project focuses on Level-2 products under ESA's operational responsibility, that is
Level-2 products in the *Polar Oceans* (incl. sea ice) and *Global Land* (incl. lakes) family. The
*Global Oceans* and *Atmosphere* products are not covered, as they are under EUMETSAT's operational
responsibility.

The table below lists the Level-2 products that are covered by the CIMR L2PAD team (-P: Polar Oceans, -L: Global Land).

Depending on the Level-2 product, different delivery timeliness are specified:
* *Near-Real-Time-3-Hour (NTR3H)*: Product delivered in <3 hour to the point of user pickup after data acquisition by
   the satellite. This is the nominal timeliness for the Copernicus Space Component.
* *Near-Real-Time-1-Hour (NRT1H)*: Product delivered in <1 hour to the point of user pickup after data acquisition by
   the satellite. In the case of CIMR, NRT1H targets support to safe Arctic navigation.
* *Non-Time-Critical (NTC)*: Product delivered in less than 30 days to the point of user pickup after data acquisition by
   the satellite.

MRD&#8209;XXXX refers to the requirement number in the [CIMR Mission Requirement Document v5](https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/EarthObservation/CIMR-MRD-v5.0-20230211_(Issued).pdf).
