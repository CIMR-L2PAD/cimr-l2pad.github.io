The Level-2 Product Algorithm Development (L2PAD) project is a four-year (2023-2027) activity initiated by the
European Space Agency (ESA) to prepare Level-2 algorithms and Ground Processing Prototype (GPP) for
the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) mission.

The CIMR L2PAD project is implemented by a consortium of European and Canadian partners, under the
lead of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (METNO). CIMR L2PAD started in late 2023.

All software, data, and algorithm documentations from CIMR L2PAD will be open, in particular the 
Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs) and the Level-2 prototype algorithms and GPP.

This page serves as a public entry-point for the project and its results. It will be developed further as objectives are reached
and results are available.
