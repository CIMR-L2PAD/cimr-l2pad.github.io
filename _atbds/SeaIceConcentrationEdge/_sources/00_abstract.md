# Abstract

Sea ice forms from seawater at the interface between the ocean and the atmosphere. Its formation plays a key role for vertical exchange
of salt and heat within the upper ocean and for the global thermohaline circulation, and its melt influences near-surface stratification
of the polar and surrounding seas. The presence or absence of sea ice has large implications for human-related activities in the 
polar regions (especially the Arctic), including shipping, resource exploitation (incl. fishing) and the lifestyle of indigeneous 
communities.

The area fraction of sea ice is also commonly named the {term}`Sea Ice Concentration` (SIC). It is a unitless number (the ratio of two
areas) and is reported either as a number in the range [0;1] or as a percentage in the range [0-100%]. SIC is by far the most important
sea ice variable when it comes to weather, ocean, and forecasting in the polar regions, and virtually all operational centers assimilate
satellite-based products of {term}`SIC` to guide there forecasts. Polar {term}`SIC` is a key requirement for the {term}`Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer` (CIMR)
mission. Timely information about SIC is also critical for safe navigation in ice-infested areas, which is why a dedicated {term}`SIC1H` Level-2
algorithm was introduced for the {term}`CIMR` mission.

Sea Ice Edge ({term}`SIED`) is a binary information derived from SIC to quickly indicate where there is sea ice and where the ocean is free for ice.
It is typically derived from a simple binary test involving a SIC threshold, classically 15% SIC (all regions with SIC larger than the threshold are considered
ice-covered). From the binary product, one can derive the contour polygon of the ice cover. A dedicated {term}`SIED1H` is also part of the
{term}`CIMR` product portofolio.

High latitude (and altitude) lakes will also freeze in winter. {term}`Lake Ice Cover` is an important component of the cryosphere and changes to the timing of
ice freeze-up, break-up, and duration can have substantial impacts on weather and climate, transportation, and ecology. While many lakes are smaller than
the resolution CIMR can resolve, several large Northern Hemisphere inland water bodies that are critical to e.g. numerical weather prediction will be observed at least daily
by the mission, with the potential of providing a high-revisit {term}`LIC` information in between the less frequent high-resolution monitoring from optical or radar imagery.
